# FreeBSD-4.11 kernel module to implement a quasi-realtime TCP/IP traffic counter

It's a kernel module to implement a quasi-realtime TCP/IP traffic counter on a gateway and traffic shaper interfaces. The module is meant as a backend for a web management console.

It's been fully tested and has been used some time ago around 2005. Fit well for production usage.

Implemented as a FreeBSD port to ease building, installation and maintenance.
